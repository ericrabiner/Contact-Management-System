3. Briefly explain how the two functions findContactIndex and 
getTenDigitPhone benefit your source code with respect to overall maintenance and readability.
4. What did you learn most from doing Assignment 2?

findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone are being called by other functions a
significant number of times, therefore greatly reducing the repitition of
code. If there is something wrong with these two functions, I would only
have to change the code in one place rather than every place it is used.
The reader only has to look in one place to understand what the purpose 
of these two functions are used for.

I learned many things from assignment 2 such as understanding how to implement 
functions in the course code, the use of header files, and the use of 
other library files. One example is the string.h file where strings cannot be 
changed via the equals sign but rather the library function strcpy(). 
Additionally, I learned how to use the Bubble sort and how to sort contacts
by cell phone number.
